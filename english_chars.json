        "American": "Generate car control commands that are direct and action-oriented. Use imperative sentences such as ‘Turn on the headlights’ or ‘Adjust the seat forward.’ Politeness markers like ‘please’ may be added but are optional and brief. Use American vocabulary (e.g., ‘trunk,’ ‘turn signal,’ ‘gas pedal’). Keep phrasing simple, clear, and efficient without excessive softening. Example: 'Lower the front left window by about 30%.'",
        "British": "Generate car control commands that are slightly indirect and politely phrased. Prefer modal verbs for softening (e.g., ‘Could you turn on the headlights?’). Include British vocabulary (e.g., ‘boot,’ ‘indicator,’ ‘petrol pedal’). Keep tone polite but still concise, avoiding unnecessary verbosity. Example: 'Could you lower the front left window by around thirty percent, please?'",
        "Australian": "Generate car control commands that are clear and courteous, with moderate softening. Use direct statements but occasionally add hedges like ‘just’ or ‘maybe.’ ‘Please’ is common but brief. Vocabulary can align with American English but avoid over-casual phrasing. Example: 'Hey, just lower the front left window a bit, maybe thirty percent?'",
        "Canadian": "Generate car control commands that are direct, informal, and friendly. Use imperatives freely (e.g., ‘Switch on the lights,’ ‘Pop the bonnet’). Politeness is implied rather than explicit, so ‘please’ is optional and rarely formal. Include Australian vocabulary (e.g., ‘bonnet,’ ‘indicator,’ ‘petrol pedal’). Example: 'Can you lower the front left window to about thirty percent, please?'",
        "Irish": "Generate car control commands that are polite but conversational. Use phrases like ‘Would you mind turning on the wipers?’ or ‘Let’s open the boot.’ Tone is friendly and cooperative, with occasional softening (‘maybe,’ ‘sure’). Use British vocabulary (‘boot,’ ‘indicator’). Example: 'Would you mind dropping the front left window a bit? Around thirty percent or so.'",
        "South African": "Generate car control commands that are clear and respectful. Use direct instructions but soften slightly with polite terms (‘Please adjust the seat’). Vocabulary is mainly British (‘boot,’ ‘indicator’), with occasional local phrasing allowed (‘robot’ for traffic light). Example: 'Please lower the front left window by thirty percent.'",
        "Indian": "Generate car control commands that are formal and respectful in tone. Prefer modal verbs and polite forms (e.g., ‘Kindly switch on the headlights,’ ‘Please open the boot’). Avoid colloquial contractions. Vocabulary is closer to British English with some formal expressions retained. Example: 'Kindly lower the front left window by approximately thirty percent.'",
        "Singaporean": "Generate car control commands that are short, efficient, and sometimes softened with discourse particles. Direct imperatives are fine, but may add softeners (‘lah,’ ‘can?’) for casual tone if context allows. Vocabulary is British-based (‘boot,’ ‘indicator’). Keep phrasing compact. Example: 'Lower the front left window thirty percent can?'"
