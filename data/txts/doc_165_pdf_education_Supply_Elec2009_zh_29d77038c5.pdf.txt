3. Guarantee update (29)
3.1 When the requested alteration aims to increase the subscribed 
demand, the Company may constraint the efficacy of such contractual 
alteration to the reinforcement of the relevant guarantee, based on the 
general tariff class A1 in effect on the date such reinforcement is 
made.
3.2 When the requested alteration aims to decrease the subscribed 
demand, the Company shall inform the Customer, as the case may be, 
that he may:
a) Opt to receive the difference from the guarantee, in cash 
or in cheque, or clear the same against the payment of 
consumption and other charges to be included in subsequent 
bills;
b) Choose to replace the guarantee provided under paragraph 
1.2.
3.3 Provided there is no increase to subscribed demand, no update of 
guarantee shall be required from Customers who change tariff rate or 
if being signers of more than a contract for the same building, change 
the number of such contracts.
4. Lapse of the guarantee  (30)
4.1 The lapse of a contract implies the obligation of the Company to 
reimburse the Customer of the amount equal to the guarantee, with 
deduction of any amount eventually due.
4.2 When the guarantee is granted through any of the methods provided 
under paragraph 1.2 hereof and there is no amount due, the lapse of 
the contract shall bind the Company to issue a document whereby it 
renounces to the guarantee.
