characteristics of the Customer’s installation, its operational schedule,

other elements that may contribute to a more exact computation of the 
amount in question.

correction of metering errors or anomalies, shall be determined by 
the sum of the amounts corresponding to the corrections applicable 
to a maximum period of twelve months prior to the month wherein 
any one of the parties expressly noti ﬁed the other of such error or 
anomaly, added the amount corresponding to the corrections to be 
made, up to the date wherein such error or anomaly was repaired.

be performed within a period equal to that wherein the error or anomaly 
has lasted, provided such period is no longer than six months.

corrections hereinbefore referred to, within the established term, shall 
set the Customer under the nonpayment provisions of clause 19.

and billing energy consumption.
